Task List

    Task FP.1 : Define a class TrafficLight which is a child class of TrafficObject. 
                The class shall have the public methods void waitForGreen() and void 
                simulate() as well as TrafficLightPhase getCurrentPhase(), where 
                TrafficLightPhase is an enum that can be either red or green. Also, 
                add the private method void cycleThroughPhases(). Furthermore, there 
                shall be the private member _currentPhase which can take red or green 
                as its value.

    Task FP.2 : Implement the function with an infinite loop that measures the time 
                between two loop cycles and toggles the current phase of the traffic 
                light between red and green and sends an update method to the message 
                queue using move semantics. The cycle duration should be a random value 
                between 4 and 6 seconds. Also, the while-loop should use 
                std::this_thread::sleep_for to wait 1ms between two cycles. Finally, 
                the private method cycleThroughPhases should be started in a thread 
                when the public method simulate is called. To do this, use the thread 
                queue in the base class.

    Task FP.3 : Define a class MessageQueue which has the public methods send and receive. 
                Send should take an rvalue reference of type TrafficLightPhase whereas 
                receive should return this type. Also, the class should define an 
                std::dequeue called _queue, which stores objects of type TrafficLightPhase. 
                Finally, there should be an std::condition_variable as well as an 
                std::mutex as private members.

    Task FP.4 : Implement the method Send, which should use the mechanisms 
                std::lock_guard<std::mutex> as well as _condition.notify_one() to add 
                a new message to the queue and afterwards send a notification. Also, 
                in class TrafficLight, create a private member of type MessageQueue 
                for messages of type TrafficLightPhase and use it within the infinite 
                loop to push each new TrafficLightPhase into it by calling send in 
                conjunction with move semantics.

    Task FP.5 : The method receive should use std::unique_lock<std::mutex> and 
                _condition.wait() to wait for and receive new messages and pull them 
                from the queue using move semantics. The received object should then 
                be returned by the receive function. Then, add the implementation of 
                the method waitForGreen, in which an infinite while-loop runs and 
                repeatedly calls the receive function on the message queue. Once it 
                receives TrafficLightPhase::green, the method returns.

    Task FP.6 : In class Intersection, add a private member _trafficLight of type 
                TrafficLight. In method Intersection::simulate(), start the simulation of 
                _trafficLight. Then, in method Intersection::addVehicleToQueue, use the 
                methods TrafficLight::getCurrentPhase and TrafficLight::waitForGreen to 
                block the execution until the traffic light turns green.
